This is the devloop source repository.

This marker file is used by the ProjectContext detection system to identify
that this is the devloop development repository, not a user project where
devloop is installed.

This enables context-aware behavior:
- Test discovery runs devloop's tests (tests/) without exclusions
- All 842+ tests are discovered and run during development
- When devloop is installed in user projects, their tests run without
  interference from devloop's test suite

Do not delete this file - it's required for proper test context separation.
