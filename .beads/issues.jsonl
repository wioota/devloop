Two-step intelligent merge (to prevent duplication):\n   Step 1: Generate aggregate template from fragments\n     - Collect all .agents/agents/*/rules.yaml\n     - Build unified AGENTS.md-compatible template\n     - Template becomes review artifact\n   \n   Step 2: Coding agent merges template + existing AGENTS.md\n     - Read existing AGENTS.md\n     - Read generated template\n     - Intelligently merge:\n       * Detect and skip duplicate sections\n       * Preserve existing customizations\n       * Merge related content by topic\n       * Maintain semantic structure\n     - Output merged AGENTS.md\n   \n   This requires AI judgment, not string matching\n\n3. Integration in devloop init:\n   - Step 1: devloop init --generate-template (produces template artifact for review)\n   - Step 2: devloop init --merge (uses coding agent to intelligently apply)\n   - Or single command that does both\n\n4. Scope: All agents (built-in and custom)\n   - Establish pattern for custom agent implementations\n\nBenefits:\n- Rules live near code\n- Smart deduplication prevents cruft\n- Preserves user customizations in AGENTS.md\n- AI judges semantic equivalence, not text matching\n- Works for both fresh installs and existing repos\n\nBlocks: None yet\nRelated to: claude-agents-1zm, claude-agents-6u4, claude-agents-mo4","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-09T16:07:34.824082368+13:00","updated_at":"2025-12-09T16:10:44.749546746+13:00"}
